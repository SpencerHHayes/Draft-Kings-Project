# Draft-Kings-Project
The Draft Kings Project seeks to generate batch files containing a set number of optimized lineups given an modified version of the roaster found on the Draft Kings website. While the current version only supports NFL roasters, the code was developed to be scalable and thus compatible with  other sports found on the DK website.
