# The Draft Kings Project
The Draft Kings Project seeks to generate batch files containing a set number of optimized lineups given a modified version of a roaster found on the Draft Kings website. While the current version only supports NFL roasters, the code was developed to be scalable and thus compatible with  other sports found on the DK website. The next version of this project hopes to be compatable with NBA roasters as well as incorporate optimizations to the ranking algorithm for all sports.
