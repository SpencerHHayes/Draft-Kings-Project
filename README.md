# The Draft Kings Project
*Developed by [Spencer Hayes](https://www.github.com/SpencerHHayes).*

The Draft Kings Project seeks to generate batch files containing a set number of optimized lineups given a modified version of a roster found on the Draft Kings website. While the current version only supports NFL rosters, the code was developed to be scalable and thus compatible with other sports found on the DK website. The next version of this project is planned to be compatible with NBA rosters as well as incorporate optimizations to the ranking algorithm for all sports.
